had to comment out error checking that checks if a gridded data's x_inc == y_inc.  This is some sort of precision error so I ignored it for the time being>

- changed grd2xyz.c (comment out calling the error function)
- ran "make" in parent directory of source.
- ram "make install" in parent directory of source

ERROR: x_inc must equal y_inc when writing to ESRI format
