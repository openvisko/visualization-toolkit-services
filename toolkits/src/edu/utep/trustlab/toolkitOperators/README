This packages contained within all contains java classes that wrap visualization toolkit functionality.
We break down visualization toolkits into two classes:

-	executable: we need to use Java to call an executable through the shell. You can find an example of this kind of service in
 	example/TargetIsExecutable.java contained within.
 	
- 	Java: we can interface directly with the toolkit's java classes and methods.
